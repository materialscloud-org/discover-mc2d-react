# MC2D discover section

Materials Cloud discover section for the Materials Cloud Two-Dimensional Structure Database (MC2D).

## Development

For local development:

```
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

This runs the frontend with the development backend URLs.

To use production backend URLs instead:

```
> npm run dev:be-prod
```

To build an optimized package with development or production backend, use respectively

```
> npm run build:be-dev
> npm run build:be-prod
```

Preview either locally with

```
> npm run preview
```

- `main`
  - deployed to https://materialscloud-org.github.io/discover-mc2d-react/
  - and is running on the production backend.
- `develop`
  - deployed to https://materialscloud-org.github.io/discover-mc2d-react/develop
